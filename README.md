Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Program
Introduction
This Python program implements a Caesar cipher encryption and decryption system. The user can input a text message, select a cipher direction (encode or decode), and specify a shift amount to perform the encryption or decryption.

Functionality
The program consists of several functions:

1. caesar(start_text, shift_amount, cipher_direction)
This function takes three arguments:

start_text: The input text that needs to be encrypted or decrypted.
shift_amount: The number of positions by which each character in the start_text should be shifted.
cipher_direction: The direction of the cipher operation, either "encode" for encryption or "decode" for decryption.
The function iterates through each character of the start_text. If the character is an alphabet letter, it is shifted by the shift_amount to obtain the corresponding character from the alphabet. If the cipher_direction is "decode," the shift_amount is negated to reverse the encryption process. If the character is not an alphabet letter (e.g., number, symbol, or space), it is kept as is in the output.

2. Main Program Execution
The main program execution follows these steps:

Import the ASCII art logo from art.py and display it at the beginning of the program.
Enter a while loop to allow the user to restart the program multiple times.
Ask the user to input the cipher direction (encode or decode), the text message, and the shift amount.
Ensure that the shift amount is within the range of the alphabet (0 to 25) by using the modulus operator (%). This allows the program to handle shift amounts greater than 26 by wrapping around the alphabet.
Call the caesar() function with the provided inputs to perform the encryption or decryption.
After each operation, ask the user if they want to restart the program. If the answer is "no," exit the loop and display "Goodbye."
Considerations and Improvements
1. Handling Non-Alphabetic Characters
The program currently keeps any character that is not an alphabet letter unchanged during encryption or decryption. This behavior is desired as it ensures that numbers, symbols, and spaces are preserved in the output. For example, when encrypting the text "meet me at 3", the result will be "•••• •• •• 3". This behavior is appropriate for many use cases.

2. Negative Shifts
If the user enters a negative shift amount, the program will handle it correctly since it multiplies the shift_amount by -1 when the cipher direction is "decode." Thus, the program supports both left and right shifts.

3. User Input Validation
The current implementation does not have comprehensive user input validation. For example, if the user enters invalid text (e.g., empty string) or a non-integer value for the shift amount, the program may raise an exception. Implementing input validation can make the program more robust.

4. Repeated Shifts
The program does not support multiple rounds of encryption or decryption with different shift amounts on the same input. Implementing this feature would allow users to apply multiple cipher operations to a single text.

5. User-Friendly Interface
The program can be further improved by adding clear instructions and error messages to guide the user through the process. Additionally, a better user interface could be developed to enhance the user experience.

Conclusion
The provided Python program offers a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption. It demonstrates the basics of encryption algorithms and provides a foundation for further improvements and expansions in functionality and usability.
